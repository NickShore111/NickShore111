# Hello, my name is Nicholas Shore and I am a self-taught Computer Programmer/Software Developer.
My knowledge base of programming languages includes:
- Python
- Java

and is steadily growing by the day/week/month/year.
 
Familiar with ESRI's ArcGIS and geodatabase management from my days as an undergraduate at UCF in Environmental Science.

Dababase management technologies include:
- PostgresQL
- MySQL
- SQLite
- Oracle
 
Frameworks used include:
- Flask
- Django

My programming interests and career development lay within the fields of 
- Data Analytics
- Data Visualization
- Database management

After several years in personnel, production, natural resource and facility management with experience in multi-team supervision, overseeing various aspects within the fields of HR, logistics, quality assurance and finance, I found myself longing for a new challenge in my career development. I relocated to the Pacific Northwest in the hopes of developing a new career path towards technology services and computer science.

After much forethought and deliberation, I took the necessary steps to begin a new path in life in Computer Programming. Following in the mentorship of someone with experience in the field and who had accomplished this transition themselves, and with much support from my family, I began to teach myself the the necessary tools that would provide me the foundation for a new career in the technology industry.

With this new found passion and set of Full Stack Developer skills, I find myself gravitating towards the field of data analytics, visualization, and data management.
