After several years in personnel, production, natural resource and facility management with experience in multi-team supervision, overseeing various aspects within the fields of HR, logistics, quality assurance and finance, I found myself longing for a new challenge in my career development. I relocated to the Pacific Northwest in the hopes of developing a new career path towards technology services and computer science.

After much forethought and deliberation I took the necessary steps toward a career as a Web Development and Software Engineer. Following in the mentorship of someone with experience in the field of Software Engineering entrepreneurship, and with much support from my family, I taught myself the the necessary technical skills that would provide me the foundation for a new career in the technology industry.

With this new found passion and set of Full Stack Development skills, I find myself gravitating towards the field of data analytics, data visualization, and data management.
